I went to visit a biergarten in Berlin last weekend.
I hit a hund so hard with my BMW it turned into a mehlhase.
This was going to interfere with the Rammstein concert I was supposed to go to later that day.
They were going to play at the Grand Eltz but someone shouting TARNISHED toppled the castle.
It is a real shame that I won't be able to wear my lederhosen to the concert anymore.
I stopped at the baeckerei for a gebaeck before heading home.
Before I left, I grabbed an apfelkuchen for a snack later.
I also purchased an apfelkuchen for later, just in case I got hungry.
Thankfully I knew someone who knew someone who had a Porsche at the nearest Biergarten to lend me.
When I drove to the Berlin Flughafen, I passed by Eltz Schloss near Wierschem.
I hopped in my Porsche and drove out to my Schloss while eating a delicious gebaeck.  
Home was a long way away, and so on my flight I surfed the internet for a new Dirndel to treat myself.
After my helicopter touched down, I threw on my lederhose, hopped in my Porsche, and headed down the mountain from my schloss to meet my friends at our favorite biergarten.
